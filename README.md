# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Kelvin Nyaberi, a graduate mechanical engineer with a strong interest in science and technology especially computer programming. I am fascinated by logic puzzles and riddles, willing to learn new things and most of the time by my own, I have the patience and resilience to solve tough problems and naturally curious about how things actually work.
